# BoardLib 🧗‍♀️

Utilities for interacting with climbing board APIs.

## Installation 🦺

`python3 -m pip install boardlib`

## Usage ⌨️

Use `boardlib --help` for a full list of supported board names and feature flags.

### Databases 💾

To download the climb database for a given board:

`boardlib database <board_name> <database_path> --username <username>`

This command will first download a [sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) database file to the given path. After downloading, the database will then use the sync API to synchronize it with the latest available data. The database will only contain the "shared," public data. User data is not synchronized. If a database already exists as `database_path`, the command will skip the download step and only perform the synchronization.

NOTE: The Moonboard is not currently supported for the database command. Contributions are welcome.

#### Supported Boards 🛹

All [Aurora Climbing](https://auroraclimbing.com/) based boards (Kilter, Tension, etc.).

### Logbooks 📚

First, use the `database` command to download the SQLite database file for the board of interest. Then download your logbook entries for a given board:

`boardlib logbook <board_name> <database_file> --username=<username> --output=<output_file_name>`

This outputs a CSV file with the following fields:

```json
["board", "angle", "climb_name", "date", "logged_grade", "displayed_grade", "is_benchmark", "tries", "is_mirror", "sessions_count", "tries_total", "is_repeat", "is_ascent", "comment"]
```

#### Supported Boards 🛹

Currently all [Aurora Climbing](https://auroraclimbing.com/) based boards (Kilter, Tension, etc.). The [Moonboard](https://moonboard.com/) was previously supported but is currently broken due to a website update. Contributions are welcome.
